## 4. Conclusion

This PRD outlines the transformation of an existing website with T-shirt content and background removal functionality into a focused background removal service with a freemium business model. The implementation of 3 free uses followed by paid options (0.7 RMB/0.1 USD per image) or advertisement viewing (30 seconds) provides users with flexibility while creating monetization opportunities.

By focusing exclusively on background removal and providing clear value through the initial free quota, the website can establish its utility before requesting payment or ad viewing. The dual monetization approach caters to different user preferences, potentially increasing overall conversion rates compared to a payment-only model.
