# Background Removal Website System Design

## Implementation approach

Based on the PRD requirements, we'll create a scalable, secure web application that offers background removal services with a freemium model. The system will support 3 free background removals per user, followed by monetization options (pay per image or watch advertisements).

Key components of our implementation approach:

1. **Backend Framework**: We'll use Node.js with Express.js for the backend API server due to its non-blocking I/O model suitable for image processing tasks and excellent scalability.

2. **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI that works well across devices.

3. **Database**: MongoDB for user data, quotas, and transaction history - providing flexibility for schema evolution.

4. **Image Processing**: We'll leverage the open-source Rembg library built on U^2-Net for high-quality background removal.

5. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with options for social login (Google, Facebook) and traditional email authentication.

6. **Storage**: AWS S3 or similar object storage for storing original and processed images.

7. **Payment Processing**: Stripe for payment processing (supports both USD and RMB through its international capabilities).

8. **Advertisement Integration**: Google AdSense for advertisement delivery with custom tracking for completion.

9. **Caching**: Redis for session management and caching frequently accessed data.

10. **Analytics**: Segment.io for tracking user behavior and conversion metrics.

11. **User Identification**: For anonymous users, we'll use a combination of browser fingerprinting and local storage to track usage.

### Difficult Points and Solutions

1. **Cross-device Quota Tracking**: 
   - Solution: Encourage user registration and implement device fingerprinting as a fallback.

2. **Ad Completion Verification**: 
   - Solution: Implement client-side monitoring with server validation checkpoints during advertisement playback.

3. **Efficient Image Processing**: 
   - Solution: Implement an asynchronous processing queue with AWS Lambda for on-demand scaling of processing resources.

4. **Payment Processing in Multiple Currencies**: 
   - Solution: Use Stripe's dynamic currency conversion with geo-based default currency selection.

5. **Security for Payment Information**: 
   - Solution: Implement Stripe Elements to ensure payment data never touches our servers directly.

## Data structures and interfaces

The system will consist of several key components that interact to provide the background removal service with quota tracking and dual monetization paths. Please refer to the `background_removal_website_class_diagram.mermaid` file for a detailed diagram of the data structures and their relationships.

The main classes include:

### User Management
- **User**: Registered users with authentication credentials, quota tracking, and usage history.
- **AnonymousUser**: Non-registered users identified by device fingerprinting, with limited quota tracking.
- **AuthService**: Handles authentication, token generation, and session management.
- **UserIdentifier**: Identifies and tracks users across sessions, particularly for anonymous users.

### Core Functionality
- **ImageProcessor**: Handles the actual background removal logic, leveraging the Rembg library.
- **QuotaManager**: Tracks and manages free usage quotas for both registered and anonymous users.
- **StorageService**: Manages upload, storage, and retrieval of images using AWS S3.

### Monetization
- **PaymentService**: Handles payment processing through Stripe for paid image downloads.
- **AdService**: Manages advertisement delivery and completion verification.
- **Transaction**: Records payment transactions for accounting and user history.
- **AdView**: Tracks advertisement views and completion status.

### Data Models
- **Image**: Stores metadata about uploaded and processed images.
- **ApiController**: Central controller managing API endpoints and orchestrating service interactions.

## Program call flow

The system flow covers key user journeys including registration, image upload, background removal processing, quota checking, and the dual monetization paths (payment or advertisement). Please refer to the `background_removal_website_sequence_diagram.mermaid` file for a detailed visualization of these flows.

Key flows include:

1. **User Registration**: New users can register to track their quota across devices and sessions.
2. **Anonymous User Identification**: Non-registered users are identified through device fingerprinting.
3. **Image Upload**: Both registered and anonymous users can upload images for processing.
4. **Background Removal Process**: Core functionality that removes backgrounds from uploaded images.
5. **Quota Management**: System checks and decrements the user's quota for each processed image.
6. **Payment Flow**: When quota is exhausted, users can opt to pay per image.
7. **Advertisement Flow**: Alternative monetization path where users watch a 30-second advertisement.
8. **Download Flow**: Delivery of the processed image after successful quota use, payment, or ad viewing.

## Deployment Strategy

We'll use a cloud-based deployment with the following components:

1. **Container Orchestration**: Docker with Kubernetes for containerized microservices.
2. **Auto-scaling**: Configure auto-scaling based on traffic patterns and processing load.
3. **Serverless Functions**: AWS Lambda for image processing tasks to optimize resource usage.
4. **Content Delivery**: CDN for fast delivery of static assets and processed images.
5. **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for managed database service with automatic scaling and backups.
6. **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring and alerting.
7. **Logging**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
2. **Authentication**: Implement JWT with short expiration times and refresh tokens.
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for API endpoints.
4. **Rate Limiting**: Protect API from abuse and DDoS attacks.
5. **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of all user inputs.
6. **Image Scanning**: Scan uploaded images for malware.
7. **PCI Compliance**: Use Stripe Elements to avoid handling payment card data directly.
8. **GDPR Compliance**: Implement proper user data handling and provide options for data export/deletion.

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Image Retention Policy**: The PRD doesn't specify how long processed images should be stored. We're assuming temporary storage with some grace period after processing.

2. **Refund Policy**: Need clarification on refund policy for failed or unsatisfactory background removal results.

3. **Advertisement Provider**: The PRD doesn't specify which ad network to use. We've proposed Google AdSense, but this may need further evaluation.

4. **Account System Requirements**: While user accounts are mentioned, it's unclear if they are mandatory or optional. We've designed for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

5. **Processing Quality Tiers**: The PRD mentions potential different quality options as a P2 feature. Further details on quality levels and their corresponding pricing would be helpful.
